GEOwidget is a MIT licensed
widget builder application for building Google Maps widgets,
like location finders.
It consists of three components: geowidget-js, geowidget-manager and
geowidget-manager-php.
geowidget-js is the actual javascripts based widget which
consumes a JSON config that is built by the manager application.
The later one consists of the client side part (geowidget-manager) which
is written in Adobe Flex and the server-side part (geowidget-manager-php),
which is written in PHP.

This is the geowidget-manager sub-project.
It is the client for the manager application which is written in Adobe Flex 3.5.
As IDE Flex Builder 3 was used. You should have at least 
a running Adobe Flex 3.5 SDK (http://sourceforge.net/adobe/flexsdk/wiki/Download%20Flex%203/)
before starting, recommended is also the IDE.
The project uses a modified version of the as3corelib (http://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/)
which source code you can find in the as3corelib folder of the geowidget-project.
As precondition you need to install the geowidget-js and 
the geowidget-manager-amf component before continuing.

For license reasons the image files noted in MISSING_IMAGES
have been removed. You need to replace them with dummies
before continuing.

After that you must be able to do a release build of the project 
which will be located in 'bin-release' afterwards. Copy this folder
with the name 'flash' to your webserver together with the other
'geowidget-js' and 'amf' folders. After that you must be able
to start a test session by calling

http://localhost/amf/testsession.php
