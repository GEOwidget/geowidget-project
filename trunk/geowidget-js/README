GEOwidget is a MIT licesened
widget builder application for building Google Maps widgets,
like location finders.
It consists of three components: geowidget-js, geowidget-manager and
geowidget-manager-php.
geowidget-js is the actual javascripts based widget which
consumes a JSON config that is built by the manager application.
The later one consists of the client side part (geowidget-manager) which
is written in Adobe Flex and the server-side part (geowidget-manager-php),
which is written in PHP.

This is the geowidget-js sub-project.
It consists only of javascript code that is minified by the
JSBuilder2 tool from sencha (http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/JSBuilder2/Readme.txt)

To create the minified javascript, you need to start the Bash-Script build.sh
(Use Cygwin on windows). Make sure that you have SUN JDK 6 or later installed.

To see what is possible copy the geowidget-js to your
localhost web server (we used Zend Server CE PHP 5.2) and try one of the examples:

1. http://localhost/geowidget-js/
2. http://localhost/geowidget-js/customers/mygolf/
3. http://localhost/geowidget-js/customers/myparis/

Important: You need to use a own web server, starting the Javascript
from the filesystem does not work, also it is recommended to use PHP 5.2
as the geowidget-manager-php project does not work with PHP 5.3
