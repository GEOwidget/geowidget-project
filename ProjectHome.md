# GEOwidget #
## Generate interactive Google Maps on which you can place as many locations (for example stores) as you need. Use GEOwidget as Store Finder, an Event Map, a Directory... ##

### The Online Management Interface ###
You can organise all your locations through the web interface and customise the map for specific needs. Adjust the size of the map, add or remove functional elements. There are many settings including individual templates for the information windows within the widget.

### The (javascript) Widget ###
This is the actual widget that is visible on the website. It uses the generated json information to configure itself and populate the locations on the map. It is possible to hack the json file with additional features not yet implemented in the web interface.

This application is ideal for business websites and online directories. It enhances the ability for visitors to fetch the needed information. Furthermore, it is so simple to use, quick and flexible that it helps saving development cost for interactive maps built from scratch.
