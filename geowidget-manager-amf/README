GEOwidget is a MIT licensed
widget builder application for building Google Maps widgets,
like location finders.
It consists of three components: geowidget-js, geowidget-manager and
geowidget-manager-php.
geowidget-js is the actual javascripts based widget which
consumes a JSON config that is built by the manager application.
The later one consists of the client side part (geowidget-manager) which
is written in Adobe Flex and the server-side part (geowidget-manager-php),
which is written in PHP.

This is the geowidget-manager-php sub-project.
It is an AMF3 backend written in PHP 5.2 for the geowidget-manager
which itself is written in Adobe Flex.
This project alone is not functional, but you will need
to install it before using the geowidget-manager.

You need to copy the project to the root of your webserver.
After that either rename the folder geowidget-manager-amf to amf or
make a link.
The web server must use PHP 5.2 (we used Zend Server CE PHP 5.2),
it is not working with PHP 5.3.

This AMF3 backend is using the Zend library Version 1.10.6,
mainly for the mail transport and the AMF functionality.

The flex backend is directly calling the amf/gateway.php file,
there you find the location of the Zend library which you need
to configure first.
Just alter the following line for this purpose:
set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . "../../library");

As the project is writing files to the amf/tmp folder, make
sure it is writable by the web server.
